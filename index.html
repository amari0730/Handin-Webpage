    <h3>3 Companies</h3>

        <li>Amazon</li>
        <li>Youtube</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Regarding the easy to use feature, which I think is very important, I would say both Spotify and Youtube make that process easy. Amazon’s requirement that you click on the actual item before adding it to your favorite’s list adds a layer of complexity that can confuse the user. In terms of customizations, all companies had that feature. In the sites you could create/edit playlists, which would allow the user to have a more personable experience. In terms of sharing options, I would say that Amazon and Spotify have sharing options. For this category I looked to see if you could share the entirety of the list rather than just particular elements of the list. And only youtube did not seem to have this feature for the full playlist. Integration with other features ensures that these favorites lists are accessible and influence a user’s experience on the site. I would say that all 3 companies appeared to have that feature. The sites use the favorites to find products you might like, make these lists easily interactable throughout the sites, and integrate favorites into other features of the application in some way. Lastly when it comes to Reminders/Notifications, it appears as though only Amazon has that feature. The other sites did not appear to notify the user of their playlists, I assume because they expect the user themselves to remember. However amazon does have a feature that reminds you of products that were favorites, to increase the likelihood of your purchasing the product.

    <h3>Website Design</h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to the theme of my website, I chose to do a herbal store. The intention of my website is to help shoppers of herbal products find and work with their favorites more easily. In terms of filter I plan on filtering products based on usages and ingredients. In terms of sorting, I plan to sort based on the prices. And for aggregation I plan to use a shopping cart.
